 * Home page — server-rendered as much as possible.
 *
 * Static sections (Experience, Work, EduHonors, Stack, Contact) are pure
 * server components: zero JS shipped for them. Interactive bits are isolated
 * into "use client" subcomponents (CommandLine, AgentGraph, Scene, Tweaks).
 *
 * The heavy Three.js scene is dynamically imported with ssr:false so it
 * code-splits into its own chunk and never blocks the initial HTML payload.
